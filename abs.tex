The NGC 3109 association is a nearly-linear group of dwarf galaxies located at the edge of the Local Group (d~1.4 Mpc). The origin of this group is unclear: is it an infalling dark matter filament, a set of 'backsplash' galaxies which have passed through the Milky Way, or a group of tidal dwarfs formed in a past Milky Way/M31 encounter? Distinguishing among these possibilities requires a complete accounting of the group galaxies group and their star formation histories. One of the 5 known association members was only recently discovered; we propose a deep MegaCam survey to search for additional galaxies. Some of these data can also be used to search for tidal features around the foreground (240 kpc) dwarf galaxy Leo I.
