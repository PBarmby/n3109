The NGC~3109 association is a nearly-linear group of dwarf galaxies located at the edge of the Local Group. 
The origin of this group is as yet unclear: is it an infalling dark matter filament, a set of `backsplash' galaxies
which have passed through the Milky Way in the past, or a group of tidal dwarfs formed in a past Milky Way/M31
encounter? Distinguishing among these possibilities requires a complete accounting of the galaxies in
the group, their star formation histories, and their kinematics. Several members of the NGC~3109 association 
have only  recently been discovered, and we propose a deep MegaCam survey to search for additional galaxies.
*Stirring final sentence here*.
