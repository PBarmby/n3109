STRONG POINTS: CanTAC agrees with the referees that deep imaging of the putative filament is very timely, and has the potential to detect interesting new structures that may help elucidate its origin.

WEAK POINTS: CanTAC shares the concerns of the referees regarding foreground and background contamination with single-band observations. A more thorough description of the technique that will be adopted to detect over-densities in the presence of contamination and the need for follow-up to achieve the science goals would have strengthened this proposal. A discussion of how the observations will constrain the underlying theory is also missing: are additional (presumably HI-deficient) satellites or stellar streams expected theoretically, and what are the implications if they are or are not found? Finally, figure 1 of the proposal could be improved by zooming in and overlaying the proposed pointings in order to demonstrate that the MegaCam footprint is larger than the width of the stream implied by the galaxy locations on the sky.
